## Overview

The IBM Cloud Code Engine Java SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the following IBM Cloud services:

Service Name | Artifact Coordinates
--- | ---
[Code Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/codeengine/codeengine-v2.0.0) | com.ibm.cloud.code-engine:2.0.0

## Prerequisites

[ibm-cloud-onboarding]: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration

* An [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud-onboarding] account.
* An IAM API key to allow the SDK to access your account. Create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
* Java 8 or above.

## Installation
The current version of this SDK is: 2.0.1

Each service's artifact coordinates are listed in the table above.

The project artifacts are published on the public [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)
artifact repository.  This is the default public repository used by maven when searching for dependencies.
To use this repository within a gradle build, please see
[this link](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html).

To use a particular service, define a dependency that contains the
artifact coordinates (group id, artifact id and version) for the service.
Here are examples for maven and gradle:

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.ibm.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>code-engine</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```gradle
compile 'com.ibm.cloud:code-engine:2.0.1'
```

## Using the SDK
Examples and a demo are available in the [module examples](/modules/examples) folder.
